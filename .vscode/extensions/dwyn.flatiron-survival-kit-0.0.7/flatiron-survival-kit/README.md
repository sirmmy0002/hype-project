New to Flatiron? Need some Visual Studio Code extensions to help get started!? Here's a survival pack that will help! This extension pack consists of a few handpicked VSCode extensions; descriptions listed below. May they help with your coding journeyðŸ™‚

# Better Comments

The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.  
With this extension, you will be able to categorise your annotations into:
* Alerts
* Queries
* TODOs
* Highlights
* Commented out code can also be styled to make it clear the code shouldn't be there
* Any other comment styles you'd like can be specified in the settings

# Path Intellisense

Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames.

## Installation

In the command palette (cmd-shift-p) select Install Extension and choose Path Intellisense.

To use Path Intellisense instead of the default autocompletion, the following configuration option must be added to your settings:

```javascript
{ "typescript.suggest.paths": false }
```

# Bracket Pair Colorizer 2

This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which tokens to match, and which colours to use.

# Custom Window Zoom

This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to set the zoom level increment/decrement level.  By default VSCode increments/decrements by '1' which equates to ~20%.  

With this extension you can set the user settings, "customWindowZoom.zoomLevelChangeValue": (value), to any decimal and the increment/decrement action will increase by whatever you set it to.  

For Example, set zoom level to .1, if you zoom in it will be .2 and if you zoom out it would be .1 again.

Current keybindings are set to cmd+9 to zoom in and cmd+8 to zoom out, windows users use control+8 & 9. Recommended to override the default (cmd-) (cmd=) zoom keybindings.
